# ðŸ“± EdTech Stream â€“ React Native (Expo) Assignment

This is a React Native app built with **Expo** as part of the assignment:  
**WebView + Notifications + Video Player**.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
The goal of this project is to demonstrate the integration of:
- A **WebView** page that embeds a website.
- **Local notifications** triggered by user interactions.
- An **HLS video player** with custom playback controls.
- **Navigation** between multiple screens.

### 1. WebView Page
- Embeds [React Native official site](https://reactnative.dev/) inside a WebView.

  - Primary stream: `https://test-streams.mux.dev/x36xhzz/x36xhzz.m3u8`.
- Features:
  - **Play / Pause**
  - **Mute / Unmute**
  - **Fullscreen toggle (landscape orientation)**
